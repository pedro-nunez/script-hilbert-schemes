\section{Conventions and notation}

We always work over $\mathbb{C}$.
By a variety we mean an integral separated scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$.

\section{Quotients of quasi-projective varieties by finite groups}

We will mostly follow the notes in \url{http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~mmustata/appendix.pdf} in this appendix.

\begin{lm}\label{lm:finitetype}
  Let $G$ be a finite group.
  Let $A$ be a finite type $\mathbb{C}$-algebra and assume that the group $G$ acts on $A$ from the left by $\mathbb{C}$-algebra automorphisms.
  Then the set of invariant elements $A^{G}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-subalgebra of $A$ which is of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$.

  \begin{proof}
    Let $\rho \colon G \to \operatorname{Aut}_{\mathbb{C}}(A)$ be the given left action.
    Let us first quickly ensure that
    \[ A^{G} := \bigcap_{g \in G} \{ a \in A \mid \rho(g)(a) = a \} \]
    is a $\mathbb{C}$-subalgebra of $A$.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $A^{G} \subseteq A$ is a subgroup.
        Indeed, since $\rho(g)$ is a ring morphism for every $g \in G$, we have $0 \in A^{G}$.
        And if $a_{1}, a_{2} \in A^{G}$ and $g \in G$, then it follows again from $\rho(g)$ being a ring morphism that
        \[ \rho(g)(a_{1}+a_{2}) = \rho(g)(a_{1}) + \rho(g)(a_{2}) = a_{1} + a_{2}. \]
      \item $A^{G} \subseteq A$ is a subring.
        We have seen already that it is a subgroup.
        Since $\rho(g)$ is a ring morphism for every $g \in G$, we also have $1 \in A^{G}$, so it remains only to show that $A^{G}$ is closed under products.
        If $a_{1}, a_{2} \in A^{G}$ and $g \in G$, then using once again that $\rho(g)$ is a ring morphism we see that
        \[ \rho(g)(a_{1}a_{2}) = \rho(g)(a_{1})\rho(g)(a_{2}) = a_{1}a_{2}. \]
      \item $A^{G} \subseteq A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-vector subspace.
        We have seen already that it is a subgroup, so it remains only to show that $A^{G}$ is closed under scalar product.
        If $a \in A^{G}$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ and $g \in G$, then we use the assumption that $\rho(g)$ is $\mathbb{C}$-linear to deduce that
        \[ \rho(g)(\lambda a) = \lambda \rho(g)(a) = \lambda a. \]
    \end{itemize}
    
    The other assertion in the lemma is that $A^{G}$ is a finite type $\mathbb{C}$-algebra.
    The idea is to write $A^{G}$ as a finite $B$-module for some suitable finite type $\mathbb{C}$-algebra $B$.
    Then it would follow that $A^{G}$ is a finite type $\mathbb{C}$-algebra as well.
    Indeed, let $\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{m} \in B$ be generators of $B$ as an algebra over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{l} \in A^{G}$ be generators of $A^{G}$ as a $B$-module.
    Then we can write any $a \in A^{G}$ as a $B$-linear combination
    \[ a = \sum_{i = 1}^{l} b_{i}e_{i}, \]
    and in turn each $b_{i}$ as an algebraic combination
    \[ b_{i} = f_{i}(\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{m}) \]
    for some $f_{i} \in \mathbb{C}[\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{m}]$.
    It follows that we can write $a$ as an algebraic combination in the variables $\beta_{1}, \ldots, \beta_{m}, e_{1}, \ldots, e_{l}$, so these elements would form a system of generators of $A^{G}$ as a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra.

    In order to construct such $B$, we first note that the inclusion $A^{G} \subseteq A$ is an integral ring extension.
    Indeed, every $a \in A$ is a root of the monic polynomial
    \[ P_{a}(t) := \prod_{g \in G}(t - \rho(g)(a)), \]
    whose coefficients are in $A^{G}$ by Vieta's formulas.
    Let $\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{m} \in A$ be generators of $A$ as an algebra over $\mathbb{C}$.
    Let $\{ c_{i,j} \}_{j = 0}^{d_{i}}$ be the coefficients of $P_{\alpha_{i}}$ for each $i \in \{1, \ldots, m\}$.
    Then define $B$ to be the $\mathbb{C}$-subalgebra of $A$ generated by all these coefficients $\{ c_{1,0}, \ldots, c_{1,d_{1}}, c_{2,0}, \ldots, c_{m,d_{m}} \}$.
  \end{proof}
